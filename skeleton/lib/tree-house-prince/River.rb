    You go to the river bank.  You feel rather thirsty and decide to have a drink.  As you take a few handfuls of fresh water, you realise that the river current is very strong.  It would be extremely dangerous to wade into the water.

    Your thirst quenched, you stand back up and look around.
    The eclectic tree house is in the centre of the meadow.
    The river is in front of you.

    What do you do?

    1. Go to the tree house.
